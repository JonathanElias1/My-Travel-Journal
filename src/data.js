The feeling was like a New York where nobody was in a rush if that makes any sense. The public transportation made everything a breeze there. I also went to that Voodoo Donut place there and I have to say it's overrated but the rest of the food I ate in Portland was some of the best I've ever had in terms of quality.",

The resort I had the opportunity to stay at due to an ex-girlfriends connections was really nice and I had my first experience with a poolside bar that I could swim to. I also went snorkeling, kayaking, and jet skiing there.",

      "I've been to Nevada and specifically Las Vegas a couple of times and I've never been that big of a fan to be honest. This journey was a business trip in which my team was on a 3 day paid documentary style film shoot in which our clients and us drove up to Elko Nevada and rescued an injured horse from being euthanized. Being in charge of filming a documentary was one of the most excruciating and rewarding experiences of my life due to how nervous I was to ensure the quality and direction of the film. It was definitely worth the experience and the scenic drive on the way to Elko was very peaceful. We also spent a couple hours in Vegas on the way back which was alright. To be honest I was so tired by the time we got there I just ate and went to bed after watching one of my business partners lose 100 bucks in 1 minute on slots.",
